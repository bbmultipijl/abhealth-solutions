					<h4>Description of the Test:</h4>
					<p>
					Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a laboratory technique to examine the cellular components of a section of tissue sample (biopsy). IHC can detect the presence of specific protein markers that can assist with accurate tumor classification and diagnosis. Antigens are proteins that are within or on the surface of a cell. Pathologists look for the presence or absence of particular antigens to assist with a diagnosis. IHC uses antibodies to detect antigens in a tissue sample. The target antigen is a marker, indicating a specific disease is present. If the antibody recognizes the antigen, it will attach (bind) to it. If the antibody binds to the antigen, the tissue sample will stain a certain color when viewed with a microscope.</p>
					
					<h4>Purpose of the Test:</h4>
					<p>Used to check for signs of disease following a biopsy. IHC is commonly used to diagnose cancer, predict treatment response and determine likely outcomes (prognosis) of the disease.</p>
					<p>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) can identify characteristics of tumor tissue that provide clues about how cancer may respond to treatment. For example, pathologists can identify cancer cells that are likely to grow in the presence of certain hormones. These cancers may respond best to treatments that block these hormones.
					</p>
					
					<h4>What we offer:</h4>
					<p>With a complete array of more than 250 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) antibodies and histochemical stains that serve as a diagnostic resource, we detect the presence, relative quantity, and localization of specific proteins to aid in determining differentiation in cancer cells to provide prognostic or therapeutic information.</p>					
					<p class="list-intro-text">Tests cover:</p>
					<ul>
						<li> An expansive menu available of immunohistochemistry tests including single antibodies and combinations</li>
						<li> Multiple in-house testing platforms that tailor methodology to each case for the most detailed information</li>
						<li> All major PD-L1 clones (22C3, 28.8, SP263, SP142) are available</li>

				<h4>Partners for Clinical Trails</h4>
				<p>We connect you with Partners that help you find and access the personalized clinical trial that is right for you.</p>
				
				<h4>The Benefit of Clinical Trails</h4>
				<p>Clinical trials play a crucial role in advancing oncology (cancer) research and improving patient care.</p>
				
				<p>Clinical trials offer patients access to cutting-edge treatments that may not be available through standard therapy options. These treatments include targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and experimental drugs that have shown promising results in preclinical studies.</p>
				
				<p>Some trials focus on specific populations or genetic profiles, helping to tailor treatments to individual patients’ needs. Participants may gain access to cutting-edge therapies before they are widely available, often when standard treatments are ineffective. This can result in increased effectiveness of treatment compared to traditional one-size-fits-all approaches.</p>
				
				<p>Participants often receive close monitoring and care, which can improve overall health outcome results during the trial period. Clinical trials foster a more personalized approach to healthcare, encouraging ongoing monitoring and adjustment of treatments based on patient responses.</p>
